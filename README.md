## About The Project

This app was the final project of [luzvaldovinos](https://github.com/luzvaldovinos), [j-wlkr](https://github.com/j-wlkr), [Arabella-Stephenson](https://github.com/Arabella-Stephenson) and [mine](https://github.com/Azzzvedo) for the [Le Wagon Fullstack Bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course/full-time).

The basic premise was to create a way for people with shared interests to engage in their preferred activity without needing to know who their activity partner was first.

## Built With

Below are the main languages, frameworks and technologies used in the creation of the app.

* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Stimulus JS](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

Along with the above listed languages and frameworks the web application was hosted on Heroku.

## Getting Started

Due to the time constraints opf the bootcamp environment the the app is currently only optimised for use on a mobile device (specifically an Iphone XR with screen dimensions of 414px x 896px) so for the best UX it is best to inspect the page and use the toggle device tool bar to switch the device to Iphone XR size. Once that's done you're good to go!
